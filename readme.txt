This project focuses on implementing a basic-level backpropagation algorithm, inspired by the "micrograd" project developed by Andrej Karpathy.

The core component of this implementation is the Value class, which serves as a container for storing data related to an object's value and gradient. Through backpropagation, the algorithm calculates the gradients of various variables with respect to the target variable and the derivative of the output with respect to each variable, d(out)/d(var). By moving in the opposite direction of the gradient's sign, we can navigate towards the minimum of the graph, thereby optimizing our neural network.

The fundamental principle behind a neural network is to iteratively update the model's parameters by leveraging the computed gradients. By continuously adjusting the parameter values in the direction that minimizes the loss function, the network gradually improves its performance. Backpropagation plays a crucial role in this iterative process, enabling the network to efficiently propagate the error gradients from the output layer back to the input layer.

By implementing backpropagation at a basic level, this project provides a hands-on understanding of the underlying mechanics of neural networks and their optimization through gradient descent. It serves as a valuable learning tool for comprehending the principles behind more sophisticated deep learning frameworks and algorithms.
