#Backpropagation Algorithm Implementation
This project focuses on implementing a basic-level backpropagation algorithm, inspired by the "micrograd" project developed by Andrej Karpathy. The core component of this implementation is the Value class, which serves as a container for storing data related to an object's value and gradient.

Value Class
The Value class represents a value in the computational graph and provides methods for performing mathematical operations and backpropagation. Let's explore the methods and functionality of this class.
